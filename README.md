# Seanime Docker Setup Guide

Welcome to the **Seanime** setup guide. This guide will walk you through running your own instance of Seanime using Docker. You can easily pull the pre-built Docker image and set up the necessary configuration files on your host machine.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system. [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Docker Compose installed. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  
## Quick Start

### Step 1: Pull the Docker Image

To pull the latest version of the Seanime Docker image, run the following command:

```bash
docker pull primordialhuman/seanime:2.1.1
```

### Step 2: Create the `config.toml` File

Create a `config.toml` file in a directory on your host system. This file contains configuration settings for Seanime.

```bash
mkdir -p ./seanime/config
nano ./seanime/config/config.toml
```

Copy and paste the following content into the `config.toml` file:

```toml
# The current version of Seanime (Do not change)
version = ''

[cache]
# The directory where cached data is stored
dir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/cache'
# The directory where transcode video segments are stored
transcodedir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/cache/transcode'

[database]
# The name of the database
name = 'seanime'

[logs]
# The directory where logs are stored
dir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/logs'

[manga]
# The directory where manga chapters are downloaded
downloaddir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/manga'

[offline]
# The directory where offline assets are downloaded
assetdir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/offline/assets'
# The directory where the offline database is stored
dir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/offline'

[server]
# The host to bind the server to
host = '0.0.0.0'
# Whether the server should run in offline mode
offline = false
# The port to bind the server to
port = 43211
# Whether SEANIME_WORKING_DIR should be the binary path (true) or the system's working directory (false)
usebinarypath = true

[web]
# The directory where custom web assets like background images are stored
assetdir = '$SEANIME_DATA_DIR/assets'
```

### Step 3: Create the `qBittorrent.conf` File

Next, create a `qBittorrent.conf` file to configure qBittorrent with default settings, including setting the default password. This file should also be located on your host system.

```bash
nano ./seanime/config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf
```

Paste the following content into `qBittorrent.conf`:

```ini
[Application]
FileLogger\Age=1
FileLogger\AgeType=1
FileLogger\Backup=true
FileLogger\DeleteOld=true
FileLogger\Enabled=true
FileLogger\MaxSizeBytes=66560
FileLogger\Path=/home/seanime/.local/share/qBittorrent/logs

[BitTorrent]
Session\ExcludedFileNames=
Session\Port=62896
Session\QueueingSystemEnabled=false

[Core]
AutoDeleteAddedTorrentFile=Never

[LegalNotice]
Accepted=true

[Meta]

WebUI\AuthSubnetWhitelist=@Invalid()
WebUI\LocalHostAuth=false
WebUI\Password_PBKDF2="@ByteArray(w57KPpiYHCad/RHP9BK0IQ==:tKKmsb9nbF6kK/ILvDvVQ+mr34s8vgPBUTAuxoyLCylDrJTQc4GqUo81nHhsZM9F3SNC75TTE0qbfebQvzOgoQ==)"

[RSS]
AutoDownloader\DownloadRepacks=true
AutoDownloader\SmartEpisodeFilter=s(\d+)e(\d+), (\d+)x(\d+), "(\d{4}[.\-]\d{1,2}[.\-]\d{1,2})", "(\d{1,2}[.\-]\d{1,2}[.\-]\d{4})"
```

### Step 4: Docker Compose Configuration

Below is the `docker-compose.yml` file, which will configure and start Seanime along with qBittorrent. Create this file in the project root directory.

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Add the following content:

```yaml

services:
  seanime:
    image: primordialhuman/seanime:2.1.1
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "43211:43211"
    volumes:
      - ./seanime/config:/home/seanime/.config/Seanime
      - ./seanime/config/qBittorrent:/home/seanime/.config/qBittorrent

   

```

### Step 5: Run the Application

Now, you can start the services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

accessing qbittorrent on port 8080
creds : 
username : admin
password : admin123

This command will build and start Seanime and qBittorrent, exposing the application on ports `8080` and `43211`.

### Step 6: Access the Application

Once the services are up and running, you can access Seanime at `http://localhost:8080` (replace `localhost` with your server's IP if running remotely).

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that all required directories for configuration and volumes are created and accessible by the Docker container.
- If there are any port conflicts, make sure the necessary ports (`8080` and `43211`) are available or adjust the `docker-compose.yml` file to use alternative ports.

## Conclusion

You now have your own instance of Seanime up and running using Docker. Feel free to contribute to the project or customize your instance as needed. If you encounter any issues, please open a ticket in the repository, and weâ€™ll be happy to help!
